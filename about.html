          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>
            When we were kids, what we loved most was to go up and down the
            hills, to breathe the fresh air and feel the freedom that only an
            open dirt path can bring you. Now we are grown up and we feel that
            this passion is to big not to be shared with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Come with us, discover the Atlantic Pearl, and you will see that the
            most beautiful experiences are lived outside the beaten path.
          </p>
          <p>
            As if all of this by itself wasn’t enough, on Full-Day Tours, we
            include lunch. We’ll teach you how to cook your own Espetada, a
            traditional very tasty barbecue.
